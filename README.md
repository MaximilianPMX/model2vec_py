## Project Overview

`model2vec` is a project designed to generate static embeddings for machine learning models. This allows for easier comparison, analysis, and downstream tasks leveraging model-level representations. The project is structured to be modular and extensible, starting with core functionality and expanding over time.

**Key Features:**

*   **Model Embedding Generation:** The core functionality focuses on creating vector representations (embeddings) of trained models.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with training, inference, and distillation modules for clear separation of concerns and easy expansion.
*   **Data Handling Utilities:** Dedicated modules for efficient data loading and preprocessing.
*   **Configurable Training Process:** Uses a configuration management system to allow customization of training parameters.
*   **Testing Framework:** Includes a suite of unit tests to ensure code reliability.

**Project Goals:**

*   Provide a robust and reliable method for generating model embeddings.
*   Create a flexible and extensible framework that can accommodate different model architectures and embedding techniques.
*   Develop a reusable library that simplifies the process of model analysis and comparison.
*   Enable the distillation of knowledge from large models into more compact representations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7 or higher
*   Pip (Python package installer)

The project relies on specific Python packages. Install them using the following:

*   PyTorch or TensorFlow (choose one)
*   NumPy

The specific installation instructions for these libraries vary depending on your system and chosen framework. Consult the official documentation:

*   PyTorch: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
*   TensorFlow: [https://www.tensorflow.org/install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd model2vec
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip  # always a good practice
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create requirements.txt manually with all required libraries.  Example below
    ```

    Example `requirements.txt` (for PyTorch):

    ```
    torch==1.10.0  #  Or your desired version
    numpy==1.21.0  #  Or your desired version
    pytest==7.0.0   #  Or your desired version
    # Add other dependencies as needed
    ```
    Example `requirements.txt` (for TensorFlow):

    ```
    tensorflow==2.6.0  #  Or your desired version
    numpy==1.21.0  #  Or your desired version
    pytest==7.0.0   #  Or your desired version
    # Add other dependencies as needed
    ```

4.  **Verify the installation:**

    Run the unit tests to ensure the installation is correct:

    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1.  **Train a model:**

    Run the `basic_training.py` example script to train a simple model:

    ```bash
    python examples/basic_training.py --config config/training_config.yaml
    ```

    Replace `config/training_config.yaml` with the actual path to your configuration file.  (Example training configuration file described in Configuration section.)

2.  **Generate embeddings:**

    Use the `inference_example.py` script to generate embeddings from the trained model:

    ```bash
    python examples/inference_example.py --model_path path/to/your/trained/model.pth --output_path path/to/output/embeddings.npy
    ```

    Replace `path/to/your/trained/model.pth` with the path to the trained model checkpoint and `path/to/output/embeddings.npy` with the desired output path for the embeddings.

### Configuration

The project uses configuration files to manage training and inference parameters.  Example `training_config.yaml` files are recommended in the `examples/` folder.

Example:

```yaml
# config/training_config.yaml
model:
  type: simple_model
  num_layers: 2
  hidden_size: 64

training:
  learning_rate: 0.001
  batch_size: 32
  epochs: 10
  optimizer: Adam
```

Load the configuration file using the `config.py` utility module, as shown in `examples/basic_training.py`.

### Examples

The `examples/` directory contains example scripts demonstrating how to use the project's core functionalities:

*   `examples/basic_training.py`: Demonstrates basic model training.
*   `examples/inference_example.py`: Shows how to generate embeddings from a trained model.
