# Inference Module

This module provides tools for generating embeddings from trained models.

## Key Components:

*   `embedder.py`: Contains the `Embedder` class, which handles model loading and embedding generation.
*   `embed_from_file.py`: A script for generating embeddings from a file containing input data.

## Usage

The `examples/inference_example.py` script demonstrates how to use the `Embedder` class to generate embeddings. You can also use `embed_from_file.py` directly from the command line.

## Further Information

For detailed information on inference options, please refer to the project documentation and tutorials.
